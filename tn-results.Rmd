# Intoduction
The 2008 presidential election between John McCain and Barack Obama resulted in the unprecedented feat of the election of the United States' first African American president. This is the first presidential election that I remember being aware of, and as such, I wanted to find out to what extent my home state's electorate supported Barack Obama in his first election. 

Tennessee has three major metropolitan areas: Nashville, Memphis, and Knoxville. Their location can be seen in the map provided below from *[Nations Online](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/USA/tennessee_map.htm)*.

# Loading libraries
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(urbnmapr)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(hrbrthemes)
```

# Load in data
```{r}
# Importing data from all states
county_results <- read.csv("countypres_2000-2016.csv")
```

# Cleaning data

## Filtering for Tennessee
```{r}
# Narrowing to Tennessee only
county_results <- county_results %>% 
  filter(state == "Tennessee") %>% 
  select(-state_po, -office)
```

### Exporting .csv of all TN election data from 2000-2016
I am leaving this commented out so that it does not produce a new .csv very time.
```{r}
# Writing .csv of full Tennessee data (for lab submission only)
# write_csv(county_results, "Tennessee.csv")
```

## Selecting necessary columns
I added FIPS so that I can merge the data onto the choropleth map later in the project.
```{r}
county_results <- county_results %>% 
  select(year, county, party, candidate, candidatevotes, totalvotes, FIPS)
```

## Renaming columns
I am using the Tidy Data format. Selecting one party so there are no NA values?
```{r}
county_results <- county_results %>% 
  rename(candidate_votes = candidatevotes) %>% 
  rename(total_votes = totalvotes) %>% 
  rename(county_fips = FIPS)

# Converting county_fips to characters
county_results$county_fips <- as.character(county_results$county_fips)
```

## Filtering to just one election year and political party
2008? Because Obama?
```{r}
county_results_08 <- county_results %>% 
  filter(year == 2008) %>% 
  filter(party == "democrat")
```

## Calculating percent of vote
```{r}
county_results_08 <- county_results_08 %>% 
  mutate(percent_vote = 100 * (candidate_votes / total_votes))
```

### Exporting .csv of clean data
This .csv file includes data for Barack Obama's 2008 election results for all counties in Tennessee.
```{r}
# Writing .csv (for lab submission only)
# write_csv(county_results_08, "tn-2008-democrats.csv")
```

# Data visualization
Talk about different visualization techniques.

## Choropleth Map
I am using the `urbanmapr` package and referencing their vignette which can be accessed *[here](https://github.com/UrbanInstitute/urbnmapr/blob/master/vignettes/introducing-urbnmapr.Rmd)*.
```{r}
# Filtering counties data set to only Tennessee
tn_counties <- counties %>% 
  filter(state_name == "Tennessee")

# Creating map
tn_counties %>% 
  ggplot(aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "grey", color = "#ffffff", size = 0.25) +
  coord_map(projection = "albers", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +
  theme_void()
```

### Merging data on to map
Using `left_join()` to combine data frames
```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Left join
dem_results_08 <- left_join(county_results_08, tn_counties, by = "county_fips")

# Adding election results to map
dem_results_08 <-  dem_results_08 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(long, lat, group = group, fill = percent_vote)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "#ffffff", size = 0.25) +
  coord_map(projection = "albers", lat0 = 39, lat1 = 45) +
  theme_void()

# Adding color to map
dem_results_08 <- dem_results_08 +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#9ECAE1", high = "#2171B5") +
  theme(legend.position = "right",
        legend.direction = "vertical",
        legend.title = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", face = "bold", size = 11)) +
  labs(fill = "Percent of Votes \nReceived")

# Adding titles
dem_results_08 <- dem_results_08 +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Votes Received in Tennessee \n for Barack Obama in 2008 Presidential Election",
       subtitle = "Carmen Canedo \n",
       caption = "\nSource: MIT Election Data & Science Lab | STAT 202, Summer 2020") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", face = "italic"),
        plot.caption = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", face = "plain"))

dem_results_08
```

## Boxplot
of percent vote

GO BACK TO EARLIER DATA FRAME `county_results_08`
```{r}
# Creating boxplot
bp_results <- county_results_08 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = percent_vote)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#64aacf") +
  theme_classic()

# Adding text
bp_results <- bp_results +
  labs(x = "Percent of Votes Received",
       y = "",
       title = "Percent of Votes Cast for Barack Obama \nby Tennessee Democrats in 2008 Presidential Election",
       subtitle = "Carmen Canedo \n",
       caption = "\nSource: MIT Election Data & Science Lab | STAT 202, Summer 2020") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Times New Roman"),
        plot.title = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", face = "italic"),
        plot.caption = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", face = "plain"))
  

bp_results
```

## Histogram
of percent vote
```{r}
# Creates base for histogram
hist_results <- county_results_08 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = percent_vote, y = ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2,
                 color = "black",
                 fill = "white") +
  theme_minimal()

# Adds median line
hist_results <- hist_results +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(percent_vote)),
             color = "red",
             linetype = "dashed")

# Changing the look of the density
hist_results <- hist_results +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.75, fill = "light blue")

# Adding text
hist_results <- hist_results +
  labs(x = "Percent of Votes Received",
       y = "Density",
       title = "Percent of Votes Cast for Barack Obama \nby Tennessee Democrats in 2008 Presidential Election",
       subtitle = "Carmen Canedo \n",
       caption = "\nSource: MIT Election Data & Science Lab | STAT 202, Summer 2020") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", face = "italic"),
        plot.caption = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", face = "plain"))

hist_results
```

## Scatter Plot
x - percent_vote
y - total_vote

```{r}
# Creating scatter plot
sp_results <- county_results_08 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = percent_vote, y = total_votes)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()

# Adding text
sp_results <- sp_results +
  labs(x = "Percent of Votes Received for Obama",
       y = "Total Votes",
       title = "Votes Recieved in Tennessee for Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election",
       subtitle = "Carmen Canedo \n",
       caption = "\nSource: MIT Election Data & Science Lab | STAT 202, Summer 2020") +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", face = "italic"),
        plot.caption = element_text(family = "Times New Roman", face = "plain"))
